# 🐍 Snake Multiplayer - [PRESS TO PLAY](rostyk-begey.github.io/snake-multiplayer/)

Custom implementation of the original ["Snake Game"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) with some extra features added.

## 🕰 The history behind the project

This game was originally created at the beginning of my development career. 👶 <br/>
(definitely not the first project, and not the 10th either, but the first one using Git and GitHub)

The aim was to gain some experience in JavaScript by doing something more difficult than just a "burger menu". <br/>
For some reason I wanted this project to be simple & tiny (in fact it isn’t 😅) so I decided to put all source code inside one file. 🤦‍♂️

Since then a lot has changed. <br/>
For me, this repository now means more than just some shitty 💩 code. <br/>
However, you can use it as a good example of "how not to write code".

## ✨ Features
- 🔈 **Sonuds**: there are sound reactions
- 👥 **Multiplayer**: play with your friend on the same PC
- 🎮 **Interface**: 
  - 🎰 score display
  - ⏯ play/pause (start moving after resuming othervise snake would eat itself)
  - 🍎 change food ammount
  - 🔇 mute/unmute
  - 🎨 change snake color
  - ➕ add/remove snake
  - 🕹 change snake controls (designed for multiplayer mode to reassign default keys)
- 🐞 **Tons of bugs**: but why not just treat them as features 🤔
